JC2-MP 0.2 README

The server requires a configuration file under the name 
config.lua. A configuration with default values has been
provided under the name default_config.lua. Simply rename
this file to config.lua and edit to your liking before
attempting to start the server.
                                                                   
Scripts must be located in the scripts/ folder in order to
be executed. If you wish to use any of the scripts in the
default_scripts/ folder you must move them.
 
Script issues and server issues are seperate, but both have
forums that can be used for troubleshooting, available at
http://www.jc-mp.com, or you may go to our IRC (Chat) channel
and attempt to elicit assistance from our community. There
are two distinct channels, #jc2-mp for general chat and
#jc2-mp.lua for scripting chat. Both channels are located on
the irc.jc-mp.com network, or available on our website under
"Chat"
 
Server console commands can both be handled by a script, or
the server itself. For stock commands please see our wiki at
